# README
This is a project that gives an idea of how spring boot with maven works 

# MY PROJECT
My project takes in user objects and asking for their name, email, password in order to register 
A form created in the index.jsp file and it saves the user's input into a h2 database.
Everything seems to be implemented correctly there are a few issues: 
* not knowing how to link back to a .jsp or go from .jsp to .jsp files 
* SQL database intake works, but it is outputted incorrectly in the table. Nonetheless it works
